            <h6>I started my career after graduating from the Academy of Art University in 2012, and worked as a freelance artist. It afforded me the easy lifestyle of a contractor, but the instability was not something that always put bread on the table (which is now gluten-free). I was lucky to find a role as an intern at a start up in Long Beach, CA, and I thought I was on my way to becoming a full-fledged 2D game artist in a budding industry. That did not last long as I was let go, and in six months, the company let go of about 100 and more of its employees to cut costs. I struggled to find work as a beginner artists and almost quit. I worked what jobs hired me to be able to afford living, and eventually, fell upon a course program called Skillcrush. I never ever stopped dreaming about being a designer, because I knew, ultimately, that this was what I was the best at. I could make other people's dreams realized on the paper or screen. Working hard, I hunkered down and studiously studied HTML and CSS to get myself here today. What I am here to do is help you find your voice -- either as a brand, a website, or a printed work -- I'm your girl. We'll get it done together.
